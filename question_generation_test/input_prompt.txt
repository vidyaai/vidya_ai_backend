Open Channel Flow (Weir or Hydraulic Jump Figure)

Generate a problem based on a hydraulic jump in a rectangular channel.

The figure must include:

Upstream depth (y1)

Downstream depth (y2)

Flow direction

Channel width

Provide flow rate and gravitational acceleration.

Ask students to:

Compute upstream Froude number

Determine downstream depth using momentum equation

Calculate energy loss across jump

Classify jump type

Comment on design implications

Include a labeled cross-sectional diagram.
