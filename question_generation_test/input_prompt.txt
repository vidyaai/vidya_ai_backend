Create 4 questions to test the students' knowledge on sequential circuit designs. Ask them questions on the following topics:
1. Output waveforms of circuits consist of 2 Flipflops and a combo logic between them. Give them the input circuit and the input waveforms for each clock cycle.
2. Ask them questions on counters like ring counter, johnston counter, decode counter etc.
Make sure all the questions consists of images and circuits.
